## Introduction

This Python3 module implements a library to access and manage resources on a oneM2M CSE.

[oneM2M](http://www.onem2m.org) is a global partnership project that specifies a common service layer, called *CSE*, for M2M and the Internet of Things. In general, devices, services, applications, and data are organized in a resources tree, which is transported and synchronized through a network of nodes. This resource tree can be access via [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations. 

The application interface to the oneM2M's *CSE* is called *Mca*. This Python3 module implements an easy way to access a *CSE* via this interface.

For further information about oneM2M and its specifications see [http://www.onem2m.org](http://www.onem2m.org) resp. [http://www.onem2m.org/technical/published-documents](http://www.onem2m.org/technical/published-documents)

### Compatibility

*onem2mlib* has been tested with the following oneM2M implementations:

-  [Eclipse om2m](http://www.eclipse.org/om2m/) (feature0 branch)

More implementations should follow.

## Installation and Prerequisites

This module requires Python3.

Copy the *onem2mlib* directory to your project.

In addition you need to install the following modules:

- [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)
- [lxml](http://lxml.de)

### requests
Install with pip3:

```bash
pip3 install lxml
```

### LXML

Install with pip3:

```bash
pip3 install lxml
```

Depending on the OS and target environment you might need to install some additional libraries:

```bash
apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev
```

#### Using a package manager
All this might take a very long time on a small system (such as a Raspberry Pi). Alternative you may install the library with the help of a package manager:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-lxml
```


## Usage[](#Usage)

Read the [full module documentation](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ankraft/onem2mlib/master/doc/onem2mlib/index.html).

Have a look at the examples in the [examples](./examples) directory on how to use the *onem2mlib* module.

The following sections provide some examples.

### Connect to a CSE

First, create a session and then retrieve a &lt;CSEBase> resource from a CSE. The session holds, for example, the authentication information to access the CSE.

```python
session = Session('http://host.com:8282', 'admin:admin').   # create a session
cse = CSEBase(session, 'mn-cse')                            # get the <CSEBase> resource
```

To use XML encoding, specify the encoding explicitly for a session.

```python
from onem2mlib.constants import *
session = Session('http://host.com:8282', 'admin:admin', Encoding_XML).   # create a session with XML encoding
cse = CSEBase(session, 'mn-cse')                                          # get the <CSEBase> resource
```

To access resources on a CSE it is not necessary to retrieve the &lt;CSEBase> resource from the CSE (for example, when one has only limited access to resources on the CSE). But one must have at least create a *CSEBase* **instance** that represents the CSE and holds the session information as shown above. This *CSEBase* instance can be used as usual in subsequent calls.

The following example creates a *CSEBase* **instance** without actually retrieving the &lt;CSEBase> **resource**. The *resourceName* attribute must be known and set explicitly in the constructor. The *instantly=False* argument must also be set; it prevents the retrieval of the actual resource (which, as explained above, might fail when there is only limited access to the CSE).

```python
session = Session('http://host.com:8282', 'admin:admin').                 # create a session
cse = CSEBase(session, 'mn-cse', resourceName='mn-name', instantly=False) # create a CSEBase object, without retrieving it
```

### Create an AE resource in a CSE

The first example creates a new &lt;AE> resource or, if an &lt;AE> resource with the same name already exists in the CSE, that &lt;AE> is returned. This method to get/create a resource is usually sufficient in most cases.

```python
ae = AE(cse, resourceName='aeName')
```

The second example is similar to the first, but offers the possibility to modify the resource object before sending it to the CSE.
In general, the *get()* method creates a new or retrieves an existing resource.

```python
ae = AE(cse, resourceName='aeName', instantly=False)
# set more attributes here
ae.get()
```

The last example also creates a new &lt;AE> resource in the CSE, but does it explicitly. It fails (ie. returns *False*) in case a resource with the same name already exists.

```python
ae = AE(cse, resourceName='aeName', instantly=False)
# set more attributes here
ae.createInCSE()
```

### Add a Container resource to an AE
Add a container to an &lt;AE> resource.

```python
container = Container(ae, resourceName='myContainer')
```

### Retrieve all Container resources of an AE
And print them.  
And add a &lt;contentInstances> to each of them.
	
```python
for cnt in ae.containers():
	print(cnt)
	# Create and add a new <contentInstance> in one step 
	ContentInstance(cnt, content='Some value')    
```

There is also a  shortcut for adding a new &lt;contentInstance> to a &lt;container>. So, the last line in this example could also be written like this:

```python
	cnt.addContent('Some value')
``` 
### Retrieve the latest &lt;contentInstance> from a &lt;container> resource
And print it.

```python 
cin = container.latestContentInstance()
if cin is not None:
	print(cin)
```

There is a short-cut in case you are only interested in the content.

```python 
print(container.latestContent())
```


### Delete an AE from a CSE
Delete an &lt;AE> resource and all its sub-resource from a CSE.

	ae.deleteFromCSE()


### Subscribe to Notifications
Add a subscription to a resource and receive notifications when the resource changes.

```python
def myCallback(resource):		# Called for notifications, with the updated resource as the argument.
	...                         # do something with the updated resource

# In the main program:
setupNotifications(myCallback)  # Initialize the notification sub-module
...
cnt = Container(ae)             # Create a container
cnt.subscribe()                 # Subscribe to changes of this resource
cnt.addContent('Some value')    # Add a new contentInstance
                                # This implicitly triggers a call to 'myCallback' when the value us changed in the CSE
```

There could also be individual callbacks for each resource. Provide another function in the *subscribe()* method call.

```python
cnt.subscribe(anotherCallback)          # Subscribe to changes of this resource, and provide a different callback function
```

Remove a subscription by calling the *unsubscribe()* method:

```python
cnt.unsubscribe()          # Notifications for this resource will stop
```


### Work with remoteCSE resources
The &lt;remoteCSE> resource represents a remote CSE to which a "local" CSE is connected. A remote CSE with the resource name *in-name* can be retrieved like this:

```python
remoteCSE = cse.findRemoteCSE('in-name')
```

The &lt;remotsCSE> resource can be used to work with the remote CSE either directly or indirectly. Direct access means that all queries are directly send to the remote CSE, while with indirect access all queries go through the "local" CSE, which then internally routes these requests to the remote CSE.

In both cases one needs to get a *cse* instance.

```python
# <CSE> resource for direct access
directRemoteCSE = remoteCSE.cseFromRemoteCSE()

# <CSE> resource for indirect access
indirectRemoteCSE = remoteCSE.cseFromLocalCSE()
```

Both resources, *directRemoteCSE* and *indirectRemoteCSE*, can be used like a normal &lt;CSE> resource as described above. The following example shows the use of both &lt;CSE> resources.

```python
# indirectly retrieve a list of <AE>'s from the remote CSE
listOfAEs = indirectRemoteCSE.aes()

# directly create a new <AE> resource on the remote CSE
newRemoteAE = directRemoteCSE.addAE('remoteAE')
```
